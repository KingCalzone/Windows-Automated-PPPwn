Main purpose: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To launch the exploit after automatically disabling and then re-enabling the ethernet cable connected to your ps4 by launching my exe named: 'PPPwn.exe'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benefits:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the perks of the C++ version, this is hands free, jailbreak can run whilst your console boots, it is also possible to set this tool as a startup app if you wish & if you have a dedicated PPPoe connection constantly plugged in.
>
press Ctrl + R and type:
>'shell:startup'

then copy the exe into the startup folder. Boom, jb on startup! ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All this tool basically does is some well needed automations for those of us without a Pi or Ethernet adapters :(... i have us covered!

Personally my wires are a headache to get to and a friend of mine found out that you can just disable and re-enable your ethernet instead of unplugging/plugging it back in!

Go and make some coffee while it runs, start to roll a spliff, something nice, the longest this has taken for me was roughly one minute. Everything required is provided, no packages or cheats included. 

Please enjoy! :) - KingCalzone <3
